The card template is designed to capture all information about a card design.
This includes:
    Card type (Normal, Special, or Ultra)
    Names and effects boxes (attack and boost), with all formatting and fonts.
    Stats, with all formatting and fonts. 0-inf, can be N/A *or* null.
    Template images, such as a card border design, or a set of stat box images.
        These will have their own JSON files, each with similar render descriptions to custom images.
    Custom images, with location, scaling, cropping, and file name, at a minimum.
Most information can be nonexistent (null) in the JSON file, including:
    Guard or Armor Stats
    Effects
    Any Cost value (force or gauge)
    Fonts
    Template images
    Custom images
These should be handled gracefully:
    Missing guard or armor should not be rendered at all.
    Same for effects and costs.
    Fonts should fall back to a default font.
    Missing template images should fall back to a set of default ones.
    Custom images are sub-objects of the larger JSON card file, which can be missing:
        Scaling - Render at 1:1 scale
        Cropping - Render uncropped
        file name (cannot be missing, but can be invalid) - Render a placeholder or error image.
Information that should not be null should be handled gracefully if possible, but an error message is also fine.
