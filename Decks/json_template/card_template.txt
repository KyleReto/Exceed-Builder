The card template is designed to capture all information about a card design.
This includes:
    Card type (Normal, Special, or Ultra)
    Names and effects boxes (attack and boost), with all formatting and fonts.
    Stats, with all formatting and fonts. 0-inf, can be N/A *or* null.
    Template images, such as a card border design, or a set of stat box images.
        These will have their own JSON files, each with similar render descriptions to custom images.
    Custom images, with location, scaling, cropping, and file name, at a minimum.
Most information can be nonexistent (null) in the JSON file, including:
    Guard or Armor Stats
    Effects
    Any Cost value (force or gauge)
    Fonts
    Template images
    Custom images
These should be handled gracefully:
    Missing guard or armor should not be rendered at all.
    Same for effects and costs.
    Fonts should fall back to a default font.
    Missing template images should fall back to a set of default ones.
    Custom images are sub-objects of the larger JSON card file, which can be missing:
        Scaling - Render at 1:1 scale
        Cropping - Render uncropped
        file name (cannot be missing, but can be invalid) - Render a placeholder or error image.
Information that should not be null should be handled gracefully if possible, but an error message is also fine.
Note that the JSON properties are not ordered.
